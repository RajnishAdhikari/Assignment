Summarization
1.	With the help of slicer, we can find the area that is given to us. Suppose if we have to find the bill amount of specific region then we can select that particular area and we will get the bill amount in average.

2.	Here card is showing the total sales or bill amount in average which simply represents the revenue of both TV subscriber and Movie package subscriber.


3.	Likewise, clustered bar chart is used to find the service failure according to area. In Hetauda, we have encountered highest number of service failure so support need to be provided so that we can improve the service. In the case of Butwal and Pokhara, least number of service failure so the number of support team should be minimized or can be transferred to the place where there is highest number of service failure.

4.	In the column chart, total number of user by Movie and Tv subscriber is shown according to area. Here Hetauda have the highest number of movie and tv subscriber then in valley like equal number of subscribers to Tv and Movie is seen. And in areas like Pokhara, Butwal and Bhairawa we do have least number of Package Subscriber. So in order to increase the user in these area, marketing campaign need to be carried out to reach to people.  


5.	Pie chart is used to show the total number of download average by area. Users in Hetauda, download more than that of Pokhara and Butwal. So in this case more bandwidth allocation need to be done in Hetauda rather than Pokhara and Butwal. 

6.	Finally from Donut chart, we can summarize that we have equal number of active number of user and people have not resubscribed the package whose contract and package has expired. So Customer Relation team should focus in this and find the root cause why people havenâ€™t resubscribed the package. If any specific issue is there then some strategy should be taken for customer retention. 

Finally, the place with highest number of TV and Movie subscriber the revenue is also high with the increasement in service failure and download average.
